title: QuieTeX
---
In my last post I showed [how to get coloured, filtered output from `latexmk`](/2019-07-23-coloured-latexmk-output/).
Since then I've been using those snippets in a few places, so in the name of reducing duplication I've packaged them up and released them as [QuieTeX](https://github.com/mje-nz/quietex) on PyPI.
Just `pip3 install quietex` and then add ``eval `quietex --latexmkrc`;`` to your `latexmkrc`.
I also found that the Python script choked when LaTeX hit an error in `errorstopmode`, so now I'm using `pexpect` instead of `subprocess` and handling that case as well.
